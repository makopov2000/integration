# springboot-IntegrationTests-Tutorial

Covers how to select and execute different groups/sub-sets of Integration Tests by taking a layered approach.

The Spring Boot testing tutorial covers how to define and activate different Spring Profiles via annotaions and
property files in order to switch between executing an embedded mongoDB integration test or a real mongoDB database.

The Project uses Spring Boot Testing 1.5 which allows you to test a slice of you application via the use the @DataMongoTest annotation and also how to perform more broad based integration testing via the use of the @SpringBootTest annotation.
